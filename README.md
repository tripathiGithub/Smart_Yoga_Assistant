# Smart_Yoga_Assistant

Want to start doing Yoga ? Don't have personal trainer who can help you in correcting your postures ?

Don't worry.. Artificial Intelligence is there for you..


Couple of months back my team :Akshay Dharmik , Suraj Shivakumar and I. started working on this yoga app to help everyone in doing yoga correctly with the help of their personal laptops and almost no cost. 

here's the demo - https://www.linkedin.com/posts/akshay-dharmik_machinelearning-deeplearning-yoga-activity-6833270743665516544-TBzc/


Our "Smart Yoga Assistant" is able to detect poses and correct them in real time using Machine Learning techniques.

All you need is a decent web camera, and you can learn yoga from anywhere!
