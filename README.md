Couple of months back I with my team started working on a yoga app to help everyone in doing yoga correctly with the help of their personal laptops and at almost no cost. 



check out the demo video- https://github.com/tripathiGithub/Smart_Yoga_Assistant/blob/main/Post.mp4?raw=true

This is a Low cost AI based application to assist users with yoga poses.

Problem Statement : Yoga is a great healer and contributor to improving strength, flexibility and endurance, but wrong yoga poses and lack of proper guidance can do more harm than good.

We have created this smart yoga application that can assist and guide individuals in learning and getting their yoga postures correct in real-time as they perform in the comfort of their own home at minimal cost


Our "Smart Yoga Assistant" is able to detect poses and correct them in real time using Machine Learning techniques.

All you need is a decent web camera, and you can learn yoga from anywhere!
